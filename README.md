## Project Overview

In this virtual internship, I worked on various data analysis tasks using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The primary objectives of the internship included:

1. Data Quality Assessment: Identifying and addressing data quality issues in the provided datasets, including missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

2. RFM Analysis: Conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment and categorize customers based on their transaction behavior. This involved calculating scores and generating insights for targeted marketing strategies.

3. Cohort Retention Analysis: Analyzing customer retention over different cohorts to understand user behavior and identify trends in customer retention rates.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the analysis, detailing the steps taken, methodologies applied, and insights derived.

- `data`: Stores the provided datasets, including customer demographic information, transaction data, and customer address details.

- `reports`: Holds the final reports summarizing the data quality assessment, RFM analysis, and cohort retention analysis, along with recommendations based on the findings.

- `visualizations`: Includes visual outputs, such as charts and heatmaps, generated during the analysis.

## Project Outcome

Through this internship, I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. The insights derived from the analysis provide valuable information for enhancing business strategies and decision-making processes.

Please feel free to explore the notebooks, reports, and visualizations to understand the methodologies used and the insights obtained.
